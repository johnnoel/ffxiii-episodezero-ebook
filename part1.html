        <h2 id="part1-chapter1" class="chapter-title">Chapter One</h2>

        <p>She knew she was surrounded, but she felt no nervousness or panic. She only thought about how it would save her the time it would take to look for them. “Just like we heard”, Lightning murmured as she readied her sword. There were several Bloodbaths, a monster that looks like a fish with amphibious arms and legs that lives by the water’s edge. On the outskirts of the Coastal City Bowdam, these sorts of aquatic monsters appear quite often. It’s not only humans that want to live here, with it’s warm temperature, water, and resort-like atmosphere, it seems even monsters find it easy living.</p>
        <p>She could detect four of the reddish grey lumps in the area. She sensed two behind her. One began to creep about. It was preparing to attack. She sliced her sword down the right side of her vision. Resistance. Now to the left. Her sword flashed, becoming her name, through the Bloodbath’s vitals. Now two are down. She felt something jump at her back. But at that speed there should be no problem. She breathed a small sigh. She whipped around and cut him down, now only one left behind her....</p>
        <p>It was then. She jumped back. She heard gunshot, and the Bloodbath burst open. Now one more was covered in it’s own green body fluids.</p>
        <p>“We’ll help!”</p>
        <p>She heard a woman’s voice along with the racket of the airbike. You aren’t helping, you’re just in the way, she thought, irritated, and lowered her weapon. The Bloodbath’s attention had already turned away from Lightning. She didn’t need to look up to know that the owner of that voice was a lower class woman By the sound of the airbike it was obviously remodeled. It wasn’t one that was designed with safety first in mind for the regular market, nor was it a military model that was made for silence. It was a different sound. The woman riding that wouldn’t be a citizen or a soldier.</p>
        <p>It was not, in fact, the woman who had a gun in one hand while controlling the airbike with the other. It was a blue haired man. He was very young. He had feather and jewel decorations all over, and even from afar you could see he was very flashy in appearance. Behind him was a black haired woman holding a huge gun at the ready. The airbike descended quickly, and the woman stood up and fired off her gun. The two remaining Bloodbath’s flew back, one after the other, and grew still. She wasn’t a bad shot. Of course, that was after she’d already wasted half her round.</p>
        <p>The airbike flew down around Lightning slowly, and put on the breaks. It was driven by someone who knows what he’s doing.</p>
        <p>“Hey there soldier, you were in a tough spot weren’t you?”</p>
        <p>The black haired woman put up her gun and smiled. The neckline of her shirt was low and open. Lightning could see a butterfly tattoo on the upper part of her shoulder blades. If the blue haired man could be said to have a lot of decorations, this woman could be said to be showing a lot of skin. Either one was not wearing clothes that someone who uses a gun would normally wear. All of those decorations hanging down would just get in the way of a gun fight. And a large gun like that heats up easily. With that much skin showing she wouldn’t be protected from burns. Amateurs, she decided, and then asked:</p>
        <p>“Who are you?”</p>
        <p>“We’re Nora.”</p>
        <p>Even though Lightning meant to sound hard and cold, the other woman hardly seemed to notice. Her amber colored eyes whirled, as if she were amused.</p>
        <p>“If you’re a soldier from Bowdam you’ve at least heard a little bit about us right?”</p>
        <p>Confident. Lightning was interested in how she managed to get so confident, but she didn’t have the time to ask.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, never.” She said, her voice curt, and she spun on her heel. She could hear their voices behind her.</p>
        <p>“But....”</p>
        <p>“Weird, I could have sworn we were more famous than that.”</p>
        <p>She walked faster so she wouldn’t have to hear their voices anymore. How annoying. They interfered with her mission, and they actually thought they were helping her. She couldn’t stand how they looked so proud of themselves, so she lied to them, and she hated herself for that too. Yes, she had lied. Lied that she had never heard of Nora. She knew of them. She had heard of a group using a small shop on the beach as a headquarters. That shop was actually a cafe, meant for tourists but mostly used by local regulars. Though it’s not the kind of place that would be popular among high school girls.</p>
        <p>“We’re like a nora-cat, a stray, that’s how we got our name.” Even more annoying, to remember that now. Lightning took our her wireless. Don’t think of unnecessary things, she said to herself. Call up the sergeant major and inform him the job is finished. That’s the most important thing to do right now.</p>

        <p class="section-break">***</p>

        <p>There were already many soldiers at the reconvening point. The Bloodbaths weren’t far from the place they were reported to be. When it’s against fast moving monsters it isn’t this easy. Monsters hate humans, so you won’t see them in business or residential districts, but the outskirts are a different story. To people living in the quiet neighborhoods built outside of the city, monsters are a huge problem. Though even an amateur can take care of one small one, they usually move in large groups. The only ones living alone are the largest and strongest of monsters. In other words, ones that if you see them then the smartest course of action would be to contact the army immediately. That’s the job usually put to the security force, Lightning’s unit.</p>
        <p>Other soldiers came up to her, congratulating her on a job well done. Lightning looked for her superior officer. No, she didn’t really need to look for him. Sergeant Major Amoda could be heard from anywhere. She went in the direction of his hearty laugh.</p>
        <p>Lightning frowned. Amoda was talking with a group she’s never seen before. And next to them was a remodeled airbike. It looked a lot like the one that blue haired man had been flying. Who was that man who was talking with the sergeant major all friendly-like? He stood confidently, but seemed to be sweltering. She couldn’t tell whether it was from his clothes or the way he moved. But she could tell just from looking at him that he was their leader.</p>
        <p>Their eyes met. Lightning stared back. She admits it was rude of her, but the man got a slightly suspicious look on his face. Realizing something was happening, Sergeant Major Amoda looked back.</p>
        <p>“Hey, Commander, welcome back.”</p>
        <p>He’s at it again, Lightning thought, shrugging her shoulders. He likes these kind of jokes.</p>
        <p>“Commander? What sort of joke is this now, Sergeant Major?” Putting emphasis on “Sergeant Major”. Unlike when she first joined, she’d gotten good at ignoring his jokes. Of course, sometimes it’s necessary to strike back.</p>
        <p>“Well you are our raid leader, right?” If he’s going to be like this there nothing really that she could say, so she sighed, and decided to ignore him.</p>
        <p>“So who is this?” She looked over to the man next to her. It didn’t matter whether you saw him from far away or up close, he looked no different. He looked like bad news.</p>
        <p>“They’re Nora, Sergeant.” A young solider cut in to the conversation.</p>
        <p>“Haven't you heard of them?”</p>
        <p>Not Nora again, nearly showing her irritation. I’d just got them out of my head and here they are back for more.</p>
        <p>“A vigilante group made up of young people from the city.” He had obviously taken Lightning’s silence as a lack of knowledge on her part. Amoda added,</p>
        <p>“Their leader is Snow here.” She felt a mixture of elation and disappointment at being proved right.</p>
        <p>“Hey.” His off-hand greeting made her even more irritated. Can’t he be a little bit more polite? she thought.</p>
        <p>“This is our raid commander. She might be young, but she’s good.” For proof, Amoda touched the handle of Lightning’s sword with his fingertips.</p>
        <p>“This is a sword she got recently. A Blaze Edge... though you guys wouldn’t really understand, if any soldier saw this they would know what it meant.”</p>
        <p>“Sergeant Major, let’s not talk about...” Lightning knew what he was going to say next and meant to stop him, but Amoda ignored her and continued.</p>
        <p>“This is a sword given to only the best soldiers. What I’m saying is, the ones who have this sword have amazing abilities. Isn’t that something?” Now that’s going a bit overboard with praise, Lightning thought. She wanted to stop him before he started going on like that, but she can never get a word in edgewise.</p>
        <p>“And her Blaze Edge is special. It has an inscription on it that says, now what was it? ‘White flash..... take on my name.’ wasn’t it?” In her mind she corrected him, ‘Call upon my name’, but she couldn’t say it aloud, it was too embarrassing.</p>
        <p>“Please, let’s just leave it at that okay?” Even though he was half joking, she was happy hearing such words from her superior officer. But there is a limit to how far you should go. Especially that Snow guy was in front of her saying “Is that right?” and “Wow that’s amazing.” while looking straight at her. It was just unbearable.</p>
        <p>“Alright, alright.” Amoda looked disappointed at first, but then laughed uproariously.</p>
        <p>“Ah, well. So that’s why our sergeant here was able to finish up so quickly. You guys were disappointed that there wasn’t much of a catch this time either, yeah?”</p>
        <p>“Nah, it’s not only the monsters that were reported that are around you know.”</p>
        <p>“Really?”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, if we smoke ‘em out, they come one after the other.”</p>
        <p>“Hey now, I’m okay with smoking them out, but don’t make too much of a disturbance.” And then he said, of course of course, and agreed wholehearted. Vigilante force? Lightning thought. Don’t make me laugh. Just a group of amateurs who’ve gotten guns and are acting all justice league... She wanted to tell them what she thought of them, but it wouldn’t change anything. You can only criticize when you expect improvement. If you don’t, then it’s just a waste of breath.</p>
        <p>“You guys have a lot of energy don’t you. Why don’t you join the army?”</p>
        <p>“Rules and uniforms just don’t fit our personality you know?” Why does this guy keep saying things that are sure to get on peoples nerves? Lightning thought. He makes me beyond angry. But Sargeant Major Amoda just laughed and said, “Watch what you say”, while slapping Snow on the back, like a good friend.</p>
        <p>“Well now that the monsters are cleaned up, we’ll be going.” At Snow’s words, they all climbed onto the airbike.</p>
        <p>“You guys better not get away with yourselves and get caught.” The young soldier from before yelled at them. He was close to them in age, and they seemed friendly.</p>
        <p>“PSICOM’s nothing like us, and they won’t over look you.”</p>
        <p>PSICOM. Public Safety and Information. The secret service within the army, they only take elite soldiers. The security force works closely with the people, so you could say they have “warmth”. But PSICOM doesn’t have that. No, PSICOM would not allow Nora to exist. But a group made up of nothing but regular citizens don’t know that. And all the members of Nora scoffed at the young soldiers kind words.</p>
        <p>“We’ll be okay. We’re stronger than any army.” The leader will be the leader, and members of the group are members. But the young soldier didn’t seem to mind, and just said “A little overconfident aren’t ya?” while laughing.</p>
        <p>Lightning thought that, not only are they lacking good sense, but they aren’t even realizing things that any normal person would realize. So, she thought that ignoring them and forgetting about them would be best. But...</p>
        <p>“Wait.” When she realized what she was doing, she had already followed after them, and stopped him. She had to say one thing, just one thing.</p>
        <p>“Your name is Snow, isn’t it.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah?” Snow had been preparing to take off, he turn around.</p>
        <p>“You’re the one whose been following my little sister around.”</p>
        <p>“Little sister?”</p>
        <p>“Serah Farron.” She hadn’t even finished saying Serah’s name before Snow said “Ah!” and leapt out of the airbike, running towards her.</p>
        <p>“So you’re Serah’s sister eh? You’re face looks similar, but you both seem so different.” He looked so happy, Lightning felt bewildered. He was like a child who’s found some candy.</p>
        <p>“Serah said that her sister was a soldier. When we met I thought maybe it might be you, but you really are her sister.” He said her name so familiarly that the irritation she had felt earlier returned to her. She was just getting ready to shout at him, when he stuck out his right hand.</p>
        <p>“Nice to meet you! I’m Snow Villiers.” His hand was huge. She thought that maybe because he was wearing leather gloves that it made his hand look even bigger. No, asking for a handshake while wearing gloves. This man really knows nothing about propriety.</p>
        <p>“Don’t get involved with my sister.” She ignored his outstretched hand. She didn’t feel like being friendly with him.</p>
        <p>“Why?” Snow’s eyes went from his out stretched fingers to Lightning’s face and back. He must not have understood what she said.</p>
        <p>“I said, don’t get involved with my sister.” Snow pulled his hand back. He finally understood it was being rejected. Even so, he didn’t give up, and he said hesitantly:</p>
        <p>“And if I did?” I don’t need to answer him, I’ve said what I planned to say, she thought. She tried to turn her back on him, but something hit her toes.</p>
        <p>A coconut. It was a kind of coconut that comes from the Bowdam palm tree, and if you say “palm tree” around here people will think of this tree. It grows quickly, and the leaves are big and wide and are enjoyed by people walking on the beach. But they are different from the regular palm tree in that the coconuts are not for eating. They are huge, and it doesn’t matter whether you steam them or cook them they can’t be eaten. Like this man, Lightning thought.</p>
        <p>“So, if did? Then what?” She put her foot down on the coconut.</p>
        <p>“Don’t.” She slowly put her fingers together and cracked the joints. This wasn’t how she had planned on getting rid of the man chasing after her sister, but it just couldn’t be helped. But then, the foot she had on the coconut fell. Snow had kicked the coconut into the air, and it made an arc, landing in his hand. He was like a kid who was good at ball kicking.</p>
        <p>“Sorry, but even if you punch me, it won’t work.” Does he want to say that some woman’s punch wouldn’t be strong enough, or is he saying that he just won’t listen to her words. Probably both.</p>
        <p>“Because I’m hard headed.” He smiled as he said it, making her more angry. She turned her back on him, and walked away. I don’t like him, she thought. Taking children and acting as their general, cheering on the weak... horrible man. Why does Serah find him interesting? Of course, she just finds him interesting. She doesn’t actually like him. Of course.</p>
        <p>“Sergeant Farron, do you know him?”</p>
        <p>They couldn’t have heard what they were talking about, but they were probably able to see them fighting. The young solider looked anxious when he asked.</p>
        <p>“No, not really.” She didn’t know him. And she never planned to have anything to do with him again. Not just herself, but her Serah as well.</p>
        <p>“I’m going back.” Lightning brushed her hair back, and walked away.</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter2" class="chapter-title">Chapter Two</h2>

        <p>The sea breeze felt good on her cheek. Serah walked aimless along the promenade, and stretched her arms out wide. The weather was beautiful. The area around the promenade was quiet. In this season all the tourists go to the beach to swim in the ocean. Team Nora’s cafe has probably been busy since morning. Even if it weren’t the season, today is Lebreau’s day to work. Her cooking always manages to bring in the locals.</p>
        <p>That’s probably why Snow was late. He probably said “I’ll leave the rest to you guys.” and then tried to leave, but then one of the regulars dragged him into a conversation. Seeing that image in her mind made Serah smile.</p>
        <p>“Hey!” she heard a voice say, and she turned around. It wasn’t Snow. It was the member of Nora named Gadot. Since he was riding the airbike by himself, he was probably just returning to work. Or maybe Lebreau had asked him to get some ingredients.</p>
        <p>“So, he’s going to be late... right?” She looked up at him and said as the airbike stopped beside her. Though he’s shorter than Snow, his large muscles often make people think of him as a giant. When Serah first met him she thought he looked big and scary, of course now she felt different.</p>
        <p>“Got caught by one of the regulars?”</p>
        <p>“Bingo. And it will probably take awhile too.” I wonder if it’s one of those long-winded customers, Serah thought. She couldn’t be sure whether Snow or Lebreau had asked Gadot to come as a messenger.</p>
        <p>“Okay, I understand. Thank you.”</p>
        <p>“Nah, I was coming this way anyway.” And with that Gadot said “see ya”, and took off again on the airbike. Serah waved goodbye and watched him leave.</p>
        <p>The quiet returned, and Serah began walking again. There is a place down near the end of the promenade where sea birds gather. She decided she’d wait for Snow down there. She never got tired of watching the sea birds playing in the waves. Serah wished she had brought something that she could have given them as food.</p>
        <p>“I love this city,” Serah murmured. The birds playing in the ocean, the color of the sky, the leaves rustling gently in the trees, even the beautifully maintained promenade. But this was Serah’s last year of high school. It has already been decided that should would go to the university in the Capital City of Eden. It’s the road she herself chose, but just thinking of leaving the city made her sad. Snow always says,</p>
        <p>“Eden is just over there. We can see each other whenever we want.” and he’d smile. Serah would always tell herself, it’s not like we’ll never see each other again. Never seeing someone again, that is something Serah understood well.</p>
        <p>The first one was her father. Even though she wasn’t an age that could understand death, Serah understood that she would never see her father again. When her mother died of a sickness, she felt it even stronger, the pain of losing someone forever. Losing someone right in front of you. Snow too, he was raised by the same insitution that Gadot, Lebreau and Yuge were. They knew the same pain. That’s why they look at people with such kindness. Even if they don’t realize it.</p>
        <p>I’m happy, Serah realized. I’m happy, so even having a little distance between us hurts. Being able to meet everyday, and talk about silly things, being surrounded by kind people. It’s been so fun, that to lose even a little bit of it hurts.</p>
        <p>“Spoiled brat. You’re being greedy.” She hit herself lightly on the head with her fist. Eden is not really as close as Snow says, but still it’s true that if we want to see each other we can. So I’m going to stop feeling so sorry for myself. I don’t want to lose the time I have left here feeling this way.</p>
        <p>She had just decided, when she saw someone running down the promenade. It was Snow. He had come sooner than she’d thought. He probably had tried his best to finish the conversation as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>“Over here!” She jumped up and waved her hands.</p>
        <p>“Did you see my sister!?” She couldn’t help yelling. Snow was slightly out of breath from running full force down the promenade, but as soon as he caught his breath, he said “Yeah I saw Lightning.”</p>
        <p>“Yesterday, we ran into each other.”</p>
        <p>Aha, so that’s why, Serah said to herself.</p>
        <p>“Why, did she say something about me?”</p>
        <p>“Nothing. But she was in a really bad mood, so I thought it was odd.” Although she was in a bad mood, she acted the same as always. Lightning never pouts like a child when she is upset. She has always been too proud to show how she is feeling. But Serah could somehow tell her sister’s moods. Like some invisible field around her slightly changes. If she were to compare it to anything she would say it’s like static electricity. You can’t see it but if you were to touch it you could feel the shock.</p>
        <p>Snow seems to be trying to get himself hurt, Serah thought with a bitter laugh. Lightning and Snow are exact opposites. Snow is faithful to his feelings, what he is thinking shows up in his face and actions, and in his words. His feelings and speech are tied tightly together. He would never lie or cheat. That’s why Serah felt she could trust him, but her sister felt differently. They don’t have anything in common, they’re like oil and water.</p>
        <p>“Dammit...” Snow scratched his head. “What should we do?”</p>
        <p>At first Serah didn’t get his meaning, but then she understood.</p>
        <p>“It’s okay, you can still come.” Next week was Lightning’s birthday. Serah got her to take some time off, just so the three of them to celebrate together.</p>
        <p>“Let’s tell her we’re dating.”</p>
        <p>“Yeah, it’s horrible having to hide it.”</p>
        <p>Serah had planned on introducing Snow to her at the birthday party. She didn’t want to have Lightning take time off just to introduce him, since that would just irritate her and with her being so busy... But Serah didn’t want to wait too long before going through with it.</p>
        <p>“If we just talk to her she’ll understand. She really is nice.” Lightning is someone who is not only tough on herself, but tough on others. And once she’s decided something, she’ll almost never go back on it, so others think her stubborn. But that is how she has been able to protect and care for me, Serah thought. Even though she was still the age where you want to be taken care of, she threw her childhood away to become strong for Serah. At their father’s funeral, and their mother’s funeral, she was their holding Serah’s hand. It was like she was saying, no matter what happens, I’ll be there for you. Serah had never forgotten the warmth of her sister’s hand....</p>
        <p>Ah, she finally found something that Lightning and Snow have in common. Even if their personalities are completely different, there is just one thing. I love them both, Serah whispered, deep in her heart. They have that in common.</p>
        <p>“No, it’ll be okay. We have to tell her. We have to get her to accept us.”</p>
        <p>“But if she gets mad, she’ll probably kill me.” Snow said it as a joke. Serah, trying not to burst out laughing, made her face look serious.</p>
        <p>“If only that is all that would happen. If she gets pissed, she’ll destroy all of Cocoon.”</p>
        <p>“She would wouldn’t she?” Snow furrowed his brows. But that was too much. Serah unintentionally let out a laugh, and Snow threw his head back and roared with laughter. I hope one day the three of us can laugh together like this, Serah thought. No we will be able to. On her birthday.</p>
        <p>“Snow!” They heard behind them, after they had been laughing for awhile.</p>
        <p>“What’s up Maqui?” Snow yelled as the airbike came closer.</p>
        <p>“They’re going out. We picked up on the army’s wireless communication. Seems there’s monsters in the woods. It’s time for Team Nora!”</p>
        <p>“Got it” Snow said, as the airbike came in to land.</p>
        <p>“Sorry Serah, I’ve got to borrow the General.”</p>
        <p>“Okay!” Serah jokingly bowed to him. Maqui was only one year younger than her, so she felt he was like a classmate.</p>
        <p>“Sorry to intrude.” Maqui said, laughing. Snow said “bastard” and pretended to punch him. They were like brothers.</p>
        <p>“Alright, well, I’m going to go home then.”</p>
        <p>“Wait! Ah, can you wait for me? I want to go shopping with you.”</p>
        <p>“For what?” Snow closed one of his eyes as he jumped in the airbike</p>
        <p>“For your sister’s present.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, a birthday present!”</p>
        <p>“I want us both to choose one. You can go on ahead to the shopping mall if you want, and look around....”</p>
        <p>“No, I’ll wait here. I'll just go walk around the Strange Ruins.”</p>
        <p>“Okay,” Snow said, as the airbike took off.</p>
        <p>“We’ll clean things up quickly!”</p>
        <p>“Be careful!” Serah said, waving her hand, though Snow and Maqui were already in the sky. She laughed, “You really are fast.”</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter3" class="chapter-title">Chapter Three</h2>

        <p>She had tried not to look like she was in a bad mood, though she was worried that it didn’t work. When she had returned home late last night, she didn’t really talk much with Serah. I’m tired, she said, and shut herself in her room. She didn’t want to say anything she might regret. Lightning thought if she opened her mouth she would start yelling at Serah to break up with that guy. She didn’t want to tell Serah she was against it. She knew her sister’s temperament better than anyone. Though she seems to be gentle and weak, on the inside she is tough. If Lightning told her that she was against it just because she didn’t like him, Serah would try to change Lightning’s mind and keep arguing about it until she did. She didn’t want to have to go through that.</p>
        <p>Lightning sighed, and cleaned the tray she used for breakfast. On days she has to leave early they would eat breakfast together, but on days like today when she had to leave later she ate alone. When Lightning got up Serah had already left. Even so, she had already prepared breakfast. Lightning’s work schedule was always changing, and she’d always had to leave quickly.</p>
        <p>Their father died early, and when their mother was alive she had to work. So Lightning’s experience with housework was far longer than Serah’s. Serah, however, was a far better cook than Lightning.</p>
        <p>“Serah’s just better at choosing delicious food.”</p>
        <p>“Mm-hmm, and I’m a better cook too.” She remembered the conversations she would have with her mother and Serah. She was always happy and smiling. But then their mother fell ill.</p>
        <p>It was just before she died. After school Lightning went with Serah to their mother’s hospital. Serah kept trying to run, but Lightning held onto her hand, saying “Don’t run, it’s dangerous.” over and over. If it was like always, she would have just been saying that, while trying to run herself. But today was different.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, when she had arrived home from school, the doctor had contacted her, telling her that her mother had worsened. The next time she goes into a fit could be dangerous, he said.</p>
        <p>There were no other family to tell. So the doctor had no choice but to tell the fifteen year old Lightning the details of her mother’s illness. If anything happens, he said, there is a social services person I can introduce you to. He told her many places she could go to get help. There are programs so that children without guardians can live freely. You don’t have to worry. You only have to think about yourself and your sister. That’s what the doctor said.</p>
        <p>But, with his words Lightning realized that she’d have to take all responsibility now. Did it show in her face? she wondered. Looking back she felt her mother knew what she was thinking.</p>
        <p>“I’m feeling good today. Yes, I think I want to eat some fruit. Serah, would you go and buy some for me?”</p>
        <p>“I’ll go.” Lightning said, standing. But her mother smiled.</p>
        <p>“Serah’s better at choosing delicious food.”</p>
        <p>“Mm-hmm, and I’m a better cook too.” Serah said, proud of herself. She left the sick room.</p>
        <p>“There will be a lot of things you’ll have to do now, not just cooking.” Her mother said. Serah’s footsteps faded into the distance. Lightning’s mother smiled at her. Yes, she understands, Lightning thought. That’s why she asked Serah for the fruit. Now she’ll talk more about what I’ll have to do. But, she didn’t.</p>
        <p>“But you know, you don’t have to do it all by yourself. There are a lot of things Serah can help you with too.”</p>
        <p>“But, mom...” She couldn’t say anything else. Her mother stretched out her hand, and held Lightning close. She stroked her hair like a small child. Lightning felt like she would cry.</p>
        <p>“Cute little spoiled girl. We used to call you that, before Serah was born.”</p>
        <p>“I don’t remember that...”</p>
        <p>“Once Serah was born, you became an older sister. You were only three. Both me and your father no longer could call you our spoiled girl.” Her mother’s voice was laughing, but Lightning could hear the pain in it. The hand stroking her hair was so thin.</p>
        <p>“After your father died, you always helped me, didn’t you. You always watched over Serah. You’re such a good big sister. That’s why I’m not worried about Serah. Because you’ll be there for her.” Her mother continued, “But Serah will be there for you too. She will help you when it hurts, she will give you strength. Don’t forget that.” And then her mother said, once more, in a small voice, “My little spoiled girl”.....</p>
        <p>The condition of her illness changed quickly after that. She had already prepared herself for it, so she accepted it without a word. That day, the moment she was held by her mother like a small child, her childhood was over. She no longer had anyone she could call mother. So she was no longer a child. Could no longer be a child.</p>
        <p>“You don’t have to do it all yourself.” Her mother had said that. But the only one who could protect Serah was her. Of course, she realized, I have to do it all myself.</p>
        <p>I want to be an adult. She felt it keenly. To protect Serah, to make my only little sister happy, I have to become an adult as fast as I can. If I can’t be an adult by law, I will have to get rid of the name my parent’s gave me and make myself an adult. It’s okay right, if I’m no longer my mother’s daughter. In exchange I will be Serah’s guardian. I will protect her. She made a vow in front of her mother’s grave. She took herself a new name, Lightning.</p>

        <p class="section-break">***</p>

        <p>At the sound of her holster failing she came back to herself. She hadn’t even realized, but she had already gotten dressed. She smiled humorlessly. It wasn’t even time to leave yet.</p>
        <p>But she had woken up earlier than she’d planned. Probably because of what happened yesterday, she wasn’t able to sleep very well. Understandable, she said to herself for the millionth time, and sighed. It just had to be that guy. She wasn’t the type of over protective sister that would want to chase away all the guys who talked to her little sister. She wanted someone who would make Serah happy. She wanted someone who would protect her. She wouldn’t let anyone who couldn’t do that near her. He didn’t have to be a smooth talker or have anything good about him you could see. He just had treat her well, and be willing to protect her.</p>
        <p>But that man could never protect her, Lightning thought. He’s just some guy playing king of the mountain. At the first sign of trouble he’d abandon Serah and run. If she let Serah cool her head a bit she’d come to understand. A straight A high school student and some worthless unemployed man could never work out.</p>
        <p>If mother was alive, could we stop Serah together?</p>
        <p>No, probably not. Lightning’s shoulders drooped. Father was sort of a dangerous type himself. He was easy-going and good-natured, but he wasn’t very reliable. Now that I’m an adult I understand that, Lightning thought. Of course, when I was a child I loved my father. In my memory he was always bright and laughing. But, if he had lived longer would I have been critical of his easy-going nature? I probably would have rebelled against him.</p>
        <p>Mother chose father anyway. She probably would have been soft for someone like Snow. She probably would have said, “If it’s the person Serah loves...” and just accepted it.</p>
        <p>So it’s up to me to protect Serah from him. I’m not mother, or father. They might have accepted it. But I won’t. Never.</p>
        <p>She put on her leather gloves, and opened the door of her room. She decided to leave early today.</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter4" class="chapter-title">Chapter Four</h2>

        <p>According to old records, the Strange Ruins of Bowdam have been here for hundreds of years. The old buildings and residences of Cocoon are usually called “historic”, but things from Pulse are called “strange ruins”.</p>
        <p>It was probably brought here during the War of Revelations, as materials to repair the places that had been destroyed. It is well know that the fal’Cie would bring in materials from Pulse to maintain the structures of Cocoon. But the strange thing is, in all those hundreds of years it was never used as materials to repair the buildings, it was never used for construction, it was never returned to Pulse. It had just remained in Bowdam, waiting.</p>
        <p>Whether there are plans for it, or whether it is being saved for something, no one knows. For the immortal fal’Cie several hundred years mean nothing. No human could understand the thoughts of the fal’Cie.</p>
        <p>In any case, it was all a mystery. Perhaps those close to the government knew something more, but a regular citizen like Serah knew nothing.</p>
        <p>“No matter how many times I see it, I still think it’s strange....” Serah looked up at the towering ruins. Who could have built this?</p>
        <p>Normal humans cannot live on Pulse. Frequent natural disasters and violent monsters running rampant make it impossible. She had heard that the only ones living there were practically barbarians. There is no way they could have built such a large complicated structure. She had heard, also, that on Pulse there is a fal’Cie just like there is on Cocoon. But unlike Cocoon’s fal’Cie, who only visits blessings on the people there, the fal’Cie of Pulse brings destruction.</p>
        <p>If that that’s the case, then it couldn’t have been the fal’Cie of Pulse. If it had been built by something as terrible as that, then it would have been dangerous to Cocoon, and Cocoon’s fal’Cie would have destroyed it and used its materials.</p>
        <p>But if it wasn’t the fal’Cie of Pulse, and it wasn’t the barbarians, then who had built it?</p>
        <p>Many books and papers had been written on the subject. Everyone wanted to know. But no answers were found. It’s an old story, that no one would find the answer is understandable.</p>
        <p>Serah became interested in history because of mysteries like these. And because of that her grades in history became much higher. She sometimes thought that if she hadn’t grown up around the Strange Ruins of Bowdam that she wouldn’t have become as interested in history, but she didn’t know for sure.</p>
        <p>There was nothing like an unsolved mystery to exhilarate Serah. Even if there was no right answer, it was fun just imagining what it could be. Of course, if the mystery was solved that would make it even better.</p>
        <p>“If only I could go inside.”</p>
        <p>But there were no entrances to the ruins. There was no information reported about what was inside. Whether there was open space just like any building or not was unknown. Serah touched the outside. It wasn’t made of stone or metal. It was cool to the touch. No, it was probably some sort of metal, just not a kind that she saw everyday. Or at least not one used for buildings.</p>
        <p>When it was made in Pulse, it probably felt very different. It has been worn down by the wind and rain of Cocoon for hundreds of years. Probably not only the texture had been changed, but the color and shape may have changed as well.</p>
        <p>Serah looked up at the top of the ruins, and slowly walked around it, keeping her gaze at the top. When she did that, it looked as if the ruins were moving. When she was little this was something her sister had showed her. She heard that her father had shown her sister. Serah had been there when he had shown it to her, but she couldn’t remember.</p>
        <p>It never changes here, Serah thought. Five years before, ten years before, now. So probably five and ten years from now it will be the same too. Even after I die, she thought, it probably still be here, unchanged...</p>
        <p>Then, she felt something strange. On the outside wall of the ruins she felt a change under her fingertips. Surprised, Serah looked at the wall. The outside wall had shifted, and that shift opened up into the inside.</p>
        <p>Serah gazed in wonderment at the inside.</p>
        <p>“It’s open!?”</p>
        <p>Since when? When she had been here a couple of days earlier there had been no change. She had looked at the ruins since she was little. She would never miss even the slightest change, especially not one as big as an entrance.</p>
        <p>Perhaps a government research team had finally managed to open it. Serah walked a ways inside.</p>
        <p>“Is anyone... here?”</p>
        <p>There was no answer. There were no guards, so it probably wasn’t a research mission.</p>
        <p>“It will be okay if I look around for a little bit ...right?”</p>
        <p>If it were found out that she entered without permission, she would get in a lot of trouble, but in the end her curiosity won out.</p>
        <p>She stepped softly inside the ruins. She hoped that she would at least be able to get to the very center. The center of the ruins from Pulse. This was something that came from outside of Cocoon. She was excited, thinking how close she was to finding out the secrets of the ruins. But the farther she went, the more she started to feel she was being disrespectful. The air inside the ruins was so cool and quiet.</p>
        <p>The ruins seemed to be far bigger on the inside than the seemed on the outside. There were paths and stairs winding everywhere inside. It was obvious that there were no people here. Not only did she see no one, but heard no voices, not even any small sound. Despite that, the inside of the ruins was bright. There were lights along the pathways. As Serah went in deeper, she wondered what sort of device was used. The lights seemed to get brighter, as if they were showing her the way.</p>
        <p>“Oh wow....!”</p>
        <p>She had only meant it as a whisper, but it echoed loud in her ears. She put her hand to her mouth. She let out a small sigh, and looked again. The architecture was strange. The floor seemed to be made of stone, but it was completely different from any of the ancient buildings in Cocoon. The floor, and walls, and paths were all made perfectly straight. So it probably made by someone skilled. The lines met together elaborately, and created a beautiful harmony.</p>
        <p>“I wonder what is in here?”</p>
        <p>She looked upwards. The ceiling far above was bright enough that she could see it clearly even from below. There was a flight of stairs that went up. There must be something there.</p>
        <p>In that moment the landing on the stairs brightened. It was like it was saying, “If you want to know more, come.” Serah didn’t hesitate for a moment, and put her foot on the stairs. Her footsteps echoed. The stair steps felt like they were a different height than the were in Cocoon, but not so much that it caused her trouble to walk up them.</p>
        <p>She went up a bit more, and came upon another straight path, but that path became another stairway shortly after. The stairway was long, but she didn’t feel tired. Everything was so much more interesting than any museum that she had ever seen. The geometric walls, the square patterns of the floor. Serah was in a trance as she made her way upward.</p>
        <p>The paths and stairs were fairly complex, but she never got lost. Like before, the way before her became brighter when she reached it. Showing her the way perhaps, but it helped her go higher.</p>
        <p>What was this place made for, she wondered. Questions she had thought about many times over the years came to mind. It didn’t seem that this place was made for anything evil. She couldn’t feel anything malevolent in the air.</p>
        <p>“But... I am a bit tired. I don’t think I’ll be able to make it to the top...”</p>
        <p>She had already passed through many stairs, paths and small rooms. She rested herself against the stairs for a moment, and looked down. She wasn’t even half way up. Of course this was the same ruins that she always thought nearly touched the heavens. It wouldn’t be easy to get to the top of this place.</p>
        <p>“Just a little bit more...”</p>
        <p>She thought if she’s going to go back down anyway, she might as well go to the midway point. Her feet were tired, but she carried on. She was breathing heavily, going slowly up the stairs, when something caught her eye.</p>
        <p>“How beautiful!”</p>
        <p>On the edge of the next landing there was a pillar of light. Different from the lights on the pathway, it was a soft, green light.</p>
        <p>“I’ll rest over there. That light probably means it’s a rest area.”</p>
        <p>When she got closer, she saw that there were more pillars of light further up. The light washed down over her, erasing her weariness. Yes, this must be a rest area, she thought, as she leaned against the pedestal.</p>
        <p>Suddenly there came a rumbling from inside the ruins. Surprised, Serah jumped up. The floor and walls in front of her began to move. She realized she must have been to optimistic about those pillars of light. They didn’t mark a rest area, but some kind of transporter.</p>
        <p>Worried, Serah looked around. Stairways were made flat, pathways turned into walls, the whole inside of the ruins was changing. On the floor below, a huge cylinder fell down with a groan. I wonder if that’s a power source, she thought.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the stairway in front of her disappeared. She thought it would become a straight path like the others, but no. There was nothing there. It turned into a dead end.</p>
        <p>“Now what’ll I do...”</p>
        <p>The rumbling stopped, and everything became quiet again. She only had a brief moment of relief before a strange red pattern floated in the space before her. It was the same strange pattern that she had seen on the lower floors. Except, she thought she had seen it before, before she ever came here. Where have I seen it? she thought.</p>
        <p>The red pattern suddenly let out a burst of bright light. Serah covered her face. A strange board appeared in the air. Not really a board, more like a floor that floats in the air.</p>
        <p>“This is... like an elevator, right? An ancient one.”</p>
        <p>She had seen ancient elevators, when she had visited one of the historical sites of Cocoon. But this “elevator” was far different from the ones she had seen before.</p>
        <p>“I guess I’ll just have to ride it and see.”</p>
        <p>Serah jumped on the platform. She didn’t even think that it might be dangerous. Like the lights on the pathways and stairs before, the elevator grew brighter too, leading her on. She was right, the elevator slowly started moving upward. Serah felt satisfied just that it would take her to the top.</p>
        <p>The ceiling grew closer. The light became so bright it hurt. Finally the elevator stopped. Have I reached the top floor? Serah wondered. The air here felt cooler than it did on the bottom floor.</p>
        <p>“Are these... crystal particles?”</p>
        <p>Floating in the cool air were millions of tiny twinkling lights. Rather than think it beautiful, she felt, somewhere deep inside her, that it was holy. She straightened her back, and walked through the sparkling particles floating through the air. It’s times like this that make you want to pray, she thought.</p>
        <p>The doors opened, like they were telling her that they will soon answer her every question. She went in. It was dark. She started to worry that this might not be a place she should be entering. But the path brightened. It wasn’t as bright as the path she was on before, but neither was it dark. This must be the right path, she thought.</p>
        <p>Serah continued on, and the light grew slowly brighter. Yes this is right, she said to herself, I’m on the right path.</p>
        <p>“Is something... there?”</p>
        <p>She couldn’t quite see in the faint light. There was something ahead of her, something huge. Something alive. And it’s moving. Inside of it, a cold light gleamed.</p>
        <p>“A crystal!? But, but why?”</p>
        <p>In the next moment a bright burning light burst forth. It was a pure white light, so bright that she had to close her eyes. But a picture formed in her mind. It was big, and horrible.</p>
        <p>What... What is it!?</p>
        <p>She screamed but nothing escaped her throat. The large, horrible something raised itself up and writhed. There was a cry, but she couldn’t hear it. No, no I can hear it. It’s a song. Someone is singing. What song is this? What does it mean?</p>
        <p>Then, she could no longer think. Everything grew dark.</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter5" class="chapter-title">Chapter Five</h2>

        <p>Lightning thought she would just walk around aimlessly for awhile before heading to work, but found herself at the shopping mall.</p>
        <p>Every year tourists come from all around for the fireworks festival in Bowdam. The festival had been around since ancient times, and there were quite a few legends surrounding it. The most popular being, “If you pray to the fireworks, your wish will come true.” Just that. Nothing else required. All you have to do is pray. Probably because it was so simple it had been believed in for decades, possibly longer.</p>
        <p>Everyone has wishes. No matter how happy you are, there will be something that could make you happier. That’s why on the night of the festival Bowdam’s gates swell with many times the usual number of people. With that many people gathering together all at once, accidents are bound to happen. So on festival night Bowdam’s security force are out on patrol. That night Lightning would be responsible for the area between the shopping mall and the beach.</p>
        <p>It’s probably a good idea to check out my area beforehand, she thought. I can figure out where each store is, decide where I will assign my soldiers, and what I should move to prevent accidents. For example, I should put a lot of people around this accessory shop. Or at least tell them that they should be on guard. Any shop with jewels in it would be in danger of robbery.</p>
        <p>She looked in one of the windows and something caught her eye. A large pendent hung from a delicate chain was on display. The pendent was of Cocoon and some sort of strange shaped object. Lightning didn’t know much about jewelry, but it looked like something Serah would like.</p>
        <p>Walking around and looking at all the things in the mall made Lightning realize how long it’s been since she’d window shopped like this. Probably since the last time she went shopping with Serah. It’s been a long time since the last time we went shopping together, she thought. Ever since I joined the army.</p>
        <p>She suddenly felt guilty. After joining, she thought that once she got used to her job she would make it up to Serah. But then a year passed, and she got more responsibility. She got even busier. Before she knew it, not only were they not going out together but they were hardly speaking with each other.</p>
        <p>When she joined, Serah was still in middle school. She was probably worried about what she would do after school or her relationships with others. Everyone has problems when they are that age. She probably wanted to ask Lightning’s advice on a lot of things. But no, Lightning had been too busy at work to listen.</p>
        <p>Serah had probably been lonely. She probably just wanted someone to talk to... that’s probably how she got drawn to a show-off like Snow. If that’s the case, she thought, then this is all my fault. If only I had been there for Serah. Even if I was busy, I could have made time for her. Why didn’t I? I swore before our mother’s grave that I would protect her, but I only made her feel lonely, so much so that she got in with that horrible man. And it’s all my fault....</p>
        <p>“Oh, how cute!”</p>
        <p>Lightning turned at the merry voice. A mother and son had stopped in front of a transportation container at the pet shop.</p>
        <p>“You like this kind of thing mom?”</p>
        <p>“What? But you used to like these too. You’d always stand in front of the store crying, saying ‘I want one, I want one!’”</p>
        <p>“And how many years ago was that?”</p>
        <p>“Not too long ago... only ten years.”</p>
        <p>Mother and son were both looking into the container. Even from behind you could tell they got along well. The son’s hair was cool silver, while the color of the mother’s hair was much warmer. Even though their hair color was different, their faces looked alike. They say boys usually look like their mothers. His height made him look about fourteen or fifteen years old. The bright orange jacket he wore made him look even more that age. I was that age when my mother died, she thought a little sadly.</p>
        <p>“These are really good with kids. They’re clever, and become easily attached to their owners.”</p>
        <p>The pet shop owner told them as he took a small bird from the container and put it into a cage. It was a chocobo chick.</p>
        <p>“These are sold out everywhere right now. Our shop in Ewleede just got some the day before yesterday and already they’re sold out. We’re going to have to send them replacements soon.”</p>
        <p>When we were children they weren’t as popular as they are now, Lightning thought, but a few people in her class had baby chocobos. Serah had a friend that she would often play with that had one, and her eyes would always sparkle when she would talk about it.</p>
        <p>“So would you like to buy one?”</p>
        <p>“Oh no, unfortunately we’re on vacation. It would be too far to take it all the way to Palumpolum.”</p>
        <p>When she heard the word “vacation”, that gave Lightning an idea. A vacation. That might be a good idea.</p>
        <p>It would be a good way to make it up to Serah for making her so lonely. She could take Serah away somewhere. Though she wouldn’t be able to take a long vacation, if she put a bunch of her days off together, they could go on a short trip. Once the festival was over with their schedule would probably be more flexible and she could put in for some time off.</p>
        <p>On my birthday, she thought, we could talk about it. On Lightning’s birthday they always spent it by making dinner together. Then Serah would give her a present that she had put a lot of thought into. This time she would be able to say thank you for the gift by telling her they would go on vacation. Just the two of them.</p>
        <p>While they were on vacation she would listen to anything Serah wanted to talk about. To make up for all the time they hadn’t talked. They would have a fun time and eat delicious foods. Of course when they got back from vacation she would make enough time to talk with Serah. She wouldn’t let her be lonely anymore. If she wasn’t lonely anymore, surely she’d open her eyes and realize that she’d almost been duped by that horrible man. And then, she’d go to the university in Eden. If she made a lot of new friends, and saw new places, surely she’d completely forget about Snow.</p>
        <p>Lightning decided it was an excellent idea. It was all thanks to that mother and son who gave her the idea. She turned around wanting to say thank you, but they were no longer in front of the pet shop. She saw them walking away together in the crowd. They had looked so happy, it made her feel warm inside thinking about them.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Lightning thought, I hope you enjoy the rest of your vacation.</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter6" class="chapter-title">Chapter Six</h2>

        <p>In the darkness she heard a voice. It said “l’Cie”. It was a voice that sounded as if it would disappear in an instant.</p>
        <p>“Why....”</p>
        <p>This was a different voice, a clearer voice.</p>
        <p>“Why did you choose someone from Cocoon?”</p>
        <p>Who was talking? What were they talking about? She wanted to ask “Who are you?”, but she found she couldn’t speak. Nor could she open her eyes or move her fingertips. She couldn’t move at all. She felt like she was floating. What is happening? she wondered. Just as she thought that, the darkness became deeper. Without even thinking to fight it, she sank back down into unconsciousness.</p>

        <p class="section-break">***</p>

        <p>She felt warmth on her eyelids. Opening her eyes, she saw blue sky above her. Not only the sky, but the outside of the ruins. How she came to be outside, laying on the ground, was a mystery. Timidly, she tried raising her right hand. She could move it. So she tried her left hand. Oh good, she thought, I can move both hands.</p>
        <p>She slowly lifted herself up, but got a bit dizzy. With both hands against the ground propping herself up, she sat for a moment.</p>
        <p>What just happened? she thought. I was walking around the ruins. And then? Then I saw that an entrance was open, so I went inside. And then? Then there were many stairs that I climbed, up and up, deep into the ruins.... I saw a large crystal. And then a pure white light. After that I can’t remember anything. As if that light burned it all away. What happened? What was that light?</p>
        <p>“Why did you choose someone from Cocoon?”</p>
        <p>She remembered that voice. Was that a dream? Probably. She had been flickering in and out of consciousness, and there hadn’t been any sign of humans in the ruins. But before she lost consciousness, that strange thing she saw. No, not strange. Horrible, repulsive. It’s name... no. No, it was a dream. It was a horrible nightmare.</p>
        <p>But, Serah thought. If I am here, then that means that someone has to have been inside the ruins. I was unconscious, someone had to be there to carry me out. She searched her memory.</p>
        <p>There was one other thing she had heard. Yes, “l’Cie”. L’Cie? That l’Cie? No, Serah shook her head. The l’Cies are nothing but an old story. More like a fairytale or a legend.</p>
        <p>There was a dull throb from deep inside her head. When she fell she probably had hit something. She wondered whether she had gotten hurt anywhere else. She moved her legs, but they didn’t hurt. She raised her head, but did not get dizzy again. Holding on to the outside of the ruins she pulled herself up. Her legs shook a bit, but she could stand.</p>
        <p>She wasn’t injured. She breathed a sigh of relief. Then her eyes fell on the black dirt covering her left arm.</p>
        <p>Ugh, she thought, turning to look.</p>
        <p>“What, what is this?”</p>
        <p>She had a black pattern covering her upper arm. It was too elaborate to have been drawn on as a prank, but it was different from the tattoo that Lebreau had on her shoulder.</p>
        <p>“I hope I’ll be able to wash it off. If I can’t... what’ll I do if I can’t?”</p>
        <p>She touched it with her fingertips, and started. She had seen this pattern before. It was a complex pattern made up of many arrows. The pattern on her arm wasn’t exactly the same, but it was similar. Yes, yes she had seen it several times before in the ruins, the same one she had seen in that red light....</p>
        <p>“Oh!”</p>
        <p>Serah said softly. She had just remembered. When she had first seen the pattern in the ruins, she thought she had seen it somewhere before. Yes, she had definitely seen it before. A long time ago, from something she had borrowed from the library.</p>
        <p>A long time ago, when enemies were sent from Pulse to attack Cocoon, the fal’Cie of Cocoon changed humans into l’Cie, making them it’s servants and giving them special powers. The l’Cie fought to protect Cocoon. It was written in the records of the War of Revelations.</p>
        <p>The fal’Cie of Pulse also created l’Cie from the barbarians, and sent them to Cocoon. It was on that page she saw the pattern, the same pattern that was now on her arm. Below it, it had said “The Mark of l’Cie - Pulse - Reproduction”.</p>
        <p>“I’m a l’Cie?”</p>
        <p>A l’Cie of Pulse.</p>
        <p>“No. No that can’t be.”</p>
        <p>This was just some cruel joke. Some joke from that voice she had heard in the ruins.</p>
        <p>“Why did you choose someone from Cocoon?”</p>
        <p>Her heart skipped a beat. Those words. It was like they were saying, “You wouldn’t normally choose someone from Cocoon.” And that means, there must be people outside of Cocoon.</p>
        <p>“In Pulse....?”</p>
        <p>Of course. The ruins came from Pulse. That voice had been saying, “Why did you choose someone from Cocoon when you would normally choose someone from Pulse?” The voice saw nothing strange about the “choosing”. Which meant, they knew that place is where l’Cie are chosen. And the one who chooses the l’Cie is the fal’Cie.</p>
        <p>Which means...</p>
        <p>“Pulse’s fal’Cie is inside the ruins?”</p>
        <p>Now everything make sense. The crystal particles in the air, the huge crystal she saw before losing consciousness... If the fal’Cie was there it all makes sense. Serah saw the fal’Cie, which made her into a l’Cie. From the fal’Cie of Pulse, the one who brings disaster on the people of Cocoon.</p>
        <p>The l’Cie chosen by Cocoon’s fal’Cie were “Holy Servants”, but the ones from Pulse’s fal’Cie were “Pawns of the Devil”, and enemies of Cocoon.</p>
        <p>“Am I? No. No it has to be a lie. It can’t be...”</p>
        <p>Serah rubbed at the black mark on her arm til it hurt. It didn’t come off.</p>
        <p>“This is just some horrible joke!”</p>
        <p>She rubbed at her arm harder. She started. The black mark was changing. It wasn’t coming off, but the shape and color changed.</p>
        <p>“No way...”</p>
        <p>It wasn’t just something scribbled on her arm. It was engraved.</p>
        <p>“No, no, no, I don’t want this.”</p>
        <p>She held her knees up to her chin. No, this can’t be. It’s just some stupid mistake. She tried to convince herself, but every time she would see the mark on her arm she’d lose hope. She couldn’t deny what she knew. It would have been easier if she had known nothing.</p>
        <p>“Snow... Lightning... I’m scared.”</p>
        <p>It wasn’t cold, but her shoulders shook. The tears rolled down her face.</p>
        <p>“Help me. Snow...”</p>
        <p>She only cried for a moment. Snow will come back soon, she thought. I don’t want him to see me like this. This horrible mark. Now that I’m a danger to Cocoon.</p>
        <p>She calmed her shaking legs, and stood. I have to leave here, she thought, now. Before Snow comes back. It was only that thought that kept her moving.</p>

        <h2 id="part1-chapter7" class="chapter-title">Chapter Seven</h2>

        <p>Where would Serah like to go? Lightning wondered.</p>
        <p>Just thinking about it made her smile. Walking around the shopping mall Lightning’s footsteps felt lighter than usual. It had been her first time in a travel agency, but the staff there were kind to her. There were plenty of places they could go even on a short vacation, they had told her. They even had sent the information data to her home address. Now on her birthday they could look through them, and make plans. It would be their first vacation together. She was sure it would make Serah happy.</p>
        <p>Thinking about Serah’s smile made her heart feel bright and warm. My treasure, Lightning thought. For that I would do anything, Lighting vowed deep in her heart. I’m sorry Serah, she thought, for not having been there for you. But I won’t make you feel lonely anymore. I won’t use my job as an excuse. I promise.</p>
        <p>She felt like she had been running forward ever since their mother’s death. I shouldn’t have to hurry anymore, I should take time to stop and relax. For Serah, and for myself.</p>
        <p>In the crowd she saw two oddly dressed people. One was a black haired woman whose clothes combined the flamboyant man and the bare-skinned woman that she had seen yesterday. I seem to be fated to meet black haired women lately, Lightning said to herself. But unlike the woman yesterday, this woman seemed to have a wild fearlessness about her. Maybe it was just the design of her blue clothes that made it seem that way. It was probably “the cutting edge of fashion” or something like that. The woman with her was wearing the same kind of clothing. They were probably wearing the same clothing brand. Perhaps they were visiting from Eden.</p>
        <p>“I don’t understand anything about fashion.”</p>
        <p>She said, sighing.</p>
        <p>“You don’t understand what?”</p>
        <p>A familiar voice said behind her. It was Sergeant Major Amoda. Lightning made a slight bow, and pointed to the two women she was watching earlier.</p>
        <p>“The clothes those two are wearing...”</p>
        <p>They weren’t there anymore. Perhaps they went into some store.</p>
        <p>“Two women?”</p>
        <p>“No, nevermind. I was just saying how I don’t know much about the latest fashion.”</p>
        <p>Included those two I saw yesterday, she added silently. I don’t get it at all.</p>
        <p>“Well maybe not you. But what about your little sister? Isn’t she interested in the... ah, latest fashion?”</p>
        <p>“If she said that she wanted to wear those kinds of clothes...”</p>
        <p>I wouldn’t allow it, she was about to say. But stopped. Amoda was just leading her on again. Lightning laughed humorlessly, that’s the Sergeant Major for you.</p>
        <p>“It’s unusual to find you at the shopping mall before work, Sergeant, doing some shopping perhaps? For the latest thing?”</p>
        <p>“Let’s stop talking about that, please.”</p>
        <p>She said it so curtly, that Amoda gestured with his hands that he was giving in.</p>
        <p>“I’m looking the area over, since this will be my patrol area during the festival. There will be quite a lot of changes to make around the shopping mall.”</p>
        <p>“I’m happy that you work so hard, but don’t you think you should wait until the day of the festival to do that?”</p>
        <p>“Well why are you here, Sergeant Major?”</p>
        <p>She decided to tease him right back. She already knew the reason. They had known each other for a long time.</p>
        <p>“Well, the same as you.”</p>
        <p>“There will be nothing for you to do then, will there.”</p>
        <p>“An old guy like me can get pretty forgetful. I’ll forget by the day of the festival.”</p>
        <p>They looked at each other and laughed.</p>
        <p>“I hope everything goes smoothly at the festival this year.”</p>
        <p>In eight days the sky above Bowdam will burst with fireworks. It will be the night people who want their dreams to come true will gather. The next day would be Lightning’s twenty-first birthday. It would be the first time in a long while she would really be able to talk with Serah. Thinking about it made her heart thrum with excitement.</p>
        <p>“Uh-oh, we can’t just stand around here all day. It’s time. Let’s go.”</p>
        <p>Lightning straightened her clothes and looked ahead. It’s time for work. It was time for her to become a soldier.</p>
        <p>“Understood, Sergeant Major.”</p>
        <p>The afternoon sunlight was bright. Weaving between the happy shoppers, the two of them walked quickly. She heard people talking of silly things, and laughing brightly. The Coastal City of Bowdam was full of sights like these. Lightning watched them, still believing that Serah was watching them too.</p>
